### About me

Hi, my name is Demian and I'm a statistician. For a short while I was a mechatronics technician and studied engineering, however, for the past 4 years I have been working in analytics. I enjoy problem-solving, collaborating, and learning new things. Mostly interested in:
- Statistical methods, surveys
- Data visualization
- Some coding and whatnot

Also I
- chose to be a statistician so I could [play in everyone's backyard](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tukey/quotations/)
