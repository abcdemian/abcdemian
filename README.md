### About me

My name is Demian, I'm a statistician; also currently pursuing a MSc in statistics at UFRGS. For a short while I was a mechatronics technician and studied engineering, however, for the past 4 years I have been working in BI/analytics. I enjoy problem-solving, collaborating, and learning new things. Mostly interested in:
- Statistical methods, surveys, analytics and whatnot
- Data visualization, UI/UX
- Some coding, simulation

Also I
- chose to be a [statistician](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tukey/quotations/) so I could play in everyone's backyard
- recreationally enjoy art, movies, games...
- have 10 tattoos, among them an Î©, a [Memento](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/) reference, and a Calvin and Hobbes panel
