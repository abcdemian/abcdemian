### About me

My name is Demian, I'm a statistician; also currently pursuing a MSc in statistics at UFRGS. For a short while I was a mechatronics technician and studied engineering, however, for the past 4 years I have been working in BI/analytics. I enjoy learning new things and applying my knowledge to solve problems. Mostly interested in:
- Statistical methods, analytics, math and whatnot
- Data visualization, UI/UX
- Some coding, simulation

Also I
- chose stats so I could play in everyone's backyard
- recreationally enjoy movies, games, [*gincanas*](https://www.instagram.com/equipetiaraju/)
- have 10 tattoos, among them an Î©, a [Memento](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/) reference, and a Calvin and Hobbes panel
